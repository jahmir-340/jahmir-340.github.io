  <p>Hello my name is Jahmir Teachey and I’m a sophomore developing my own portfolio website. I have a few years of programming and only a few months of interface design. The website that I will continue to develop will be a place to showcase all the work I've done and completed along the way on my journey of knowledge. The main focus of this website will be to educate others around the world about my photography and to spread my vision to the world. When I first started my journey and posted my first picture to my photography page on instagram. I saw the bio feature on instagram and I had no idea what I wanted to put there. But something in my mind said “I want to capture what was once lost to myself and others around me”. That’s stuck with me for the months I’ve been working on these projects. I want to take what we see everyday and no one even bats an eye at, and capture it again to preserve it.
